Game idea!
Tentative names:
'Beat Mage'
'Caster Blaster'
Team: Daniel, Catherine, Annika, Josh

Using Pygame to make a game where players duel with spells.

To Implement:

Create Images/Pixel art to use in the game (Annika)
Deal with key events and input window (Josh)
Figuring out Hex grid (Catherine)
Spell design and implementation (Daniel)

Of course we can implement more later but this is a good start!
