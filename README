'Beat Mage' Idea for CalvinHacks
Team: Daniel, Catherine, Annika, Josh

Using Pygame to make a game where players duel with spells.

To Implement:

Find Images to use in the game (Annika)
Deal with key events and input window (Josh)
Figuring out Hex grid (Catherine)
Spell design and implementation (Daniel)

Of course we can implement more later but this is a good start!
